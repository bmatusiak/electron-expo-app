# electron-expo-app

A small example project for developing, testing, and inspecting how Expo web apps are packaged for Electron — including support for native modules.

Overview
- Purpose: iterate on building an Expo web app inside Electron, exercise native modules, and inspect the generated Electron app bundle.

Important notes
- Generated output: Do not edit the `electron/` folder directly — it is generated by the `expo-electron` tooling.
- Template location: the Electron entry template is at [expo-electron/main/main.js](expo-electron/main/main.js).
 - Preload: `preload.js` is produced automatically by the autolink process; changes should be made in the autolink source, not the generated file.
 - Template changes: If you modify `expo-electron/main/main.js`, delete the generated `electron/` folder before regenerating or rebuilding so the generator will re-copy the template files into the output. Note: `electron/build/` is cleaned automatically by the build process and normally does not require manual removal.

Repository layout (high level)
- `electron/` — generated build output and packaged app assets.
- `modules/example-native-module/` — example native addon source and build artifacts.
- `expo-electron/` — local helper/cli used to generate the `electron/` folder and templates.

Development tips
- Make changes in the source folders (`expo-electron/`, `modules/*`, project root) and re-run the generator instead of editing `electron/` directly.
- Inspect `electron/build/` for the packaged app and static assets produced during a build.
